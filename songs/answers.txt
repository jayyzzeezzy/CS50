Question 1: It will depend on what songs are in this listener's playlists. Generally songs in 2018 are about 5 years old if we are 2023 inclusive.
I would definitely include a throwback label in their aura. For example, if this listener is a fan of the Astroworld album,
then I would lable this listen's aura as euphoric or euphoric rap. The songs in Astroworld are largely high in energy and danceability levels
so I would describe this listener's aura as high energy or euphoric.
Ultimately, it will largely depend on what are the exact songs in listener's playlist.

Question 2: One downside of this method is that the top 100 songs might not be enough data to represent the listener's aura entirely.
For example, this person might listen to a lot of rap songs in one year but they are actually a fan of pop songs.
If their top 20 songs are largely occupied by rap songs, then the calculation can be skewed towards rap more than pop.
One suggestion to prevent situations like this would be to explore the median number rather than the average number.
